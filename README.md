# DnD5e Expanded ChatLogEntry Context Menu Options

This module injects additional options to the existing ChatLogEntryContext list that opens when a user right-clicks chat log entries.

## Additional Options

- Apply rolled temp hp to selected actor. ChatLogEntry must be a roll, and the user must have an actor selected on the canvas before this option appears, just like the normal array of damage/healing options.
